        <p><h3>Containment Procedures:</h3><p></p>Non-SCP personnel: Do NOT attempt to contain SCP 199. You will die and fail whereas SCP personnel will die and succeed. This is the most dangerous anomaly in the Mountain West by a large margin. Should any civilians encounter this SCP, attempt to flee and take shelter as soon as possible. 199 is the most active between 3-4 a.m. Civilians should stay clear of the southern end of Provo around this time. </p>


            <p>SCP-Personnel: Should you receive a report of a 199 sighting, do not engage alone. Recommended an accompanying fireteam of 10-15 containment operators with heavy weaponry. Once in the target location, place a container of Pennzoil Ultra Platinum Full Synthetic 5W-20 Motor Oil (this label only)
                in the middle of the street and evacuate all civilians in a 10-block radius. Once 199 is drawn to the motor oil, radio in an airstrike and open fire using depleted uranium ammunition. Past operations have shown that no other bullets will so much as scratch 199’s paint. 
               </p>
            
            
            <p>Keep SCP-199 distracted until the airstrike arrives. At that moment the entire area will be carpet-bombed. This will not harm the SCP, but will likely bury it in enough rubble to keep it immobilized for a few more decades. </p>            
            
            <p>Disclaimer: We haven’t actually tried this before, but nothing else has worked so at this point, we’re not sure what else will. Also, most operators will not survive their first few minutes </p>
