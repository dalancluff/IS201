        <p><h3>Containment Procedures:</h3><p></p>SCP-186 is a common North American Mountain Lion with abnormally high intelligence and an unfortunate case of facial paralysis. When not being constantly praised and adored, 186 slowly returns to his primal state and can quickly pose danger to those around him. In 1953, BYU successfully lobbied for custody of 186. While not requiring incarceration like most SCPs, his custody remains supervised by SCP-Provo. Constant praise and adoration keeps him in check while bringing in millions in revenue for BYU.</p>


            <p>Praise and Adoration: Public containment and bounties of SCP-186 have been deemed unnecessary. 186 can often be seen at BYU sporting events performing superhuman stunts to the enjoyment of spectators.</p>
            
            
            <p>Tucanos Brazilian Grill: Should SCP-186 go AWOL from his responsibilities, it is best to buy him dinner at Tucanos before he reverts to his primal state. 186 has been known to spend over 6 hours at the venue enjoying the various meats. This is sufficient stalling time for his BYU handlers or SCP personnel to arrive and contain him.</p>
