        <p><h3>Containment Procedures:</h3><p></p>SCP-201 stands on a relatively low danger level. The easiest way to contain him is by appeasement using Spikeball, web development, or salt water taffy. SCP-201 is a skinwalker with a soothing mental condition that effectively lowers his danger level to that of an average human. He is currently taking on the identity and liking of BYU student Solomon Berry. The whereabouts of the original Solomon Berry are currently unknown. Thought and prayers. Past identities 201 has gone by include BYU President Kevin James Worthen, BYU basketball star Tyler Haws, and Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera, commonly known as Mexican drug lord "El Chapo".</p>


            <p>*Notice* SCP-201 is not to be engaged by violent means. Having a skin strength of 320,000 PSI, most bullets, grenades, and melee weapons will have no effect on him.</p>
            
            
            <p>Spikeball: SCP-201 drawn to spikeball and very good at it. However, containment is not as easy as it seems. Most spikeball players are unable to keep up with him and are quickly tired out. If you challenge him to a tournament, please notify SCP personnel immediately so that we may capture him while you are stalling. </p>
            
            
            <p>Webdev: Being an IS major, SCP-201 can be easily distracted by a website development project. Five minutes into a project, he enters the “zone” in which all his attention is devoted to writing code. Once he is trapped in the zone, SCP personnel should be notified to apprehend him while distracted. Any webdev project given to SCP-201 must be vague, unspecific, and advanced. If the project is too simple, 201 will simply contact SCP-270, commonly known as ChatGPT to write the code for him, thus reducing his amount of time spent in the zone.</p>
            
            
            <p>Salt water taffy: Salt water taffy is often used by SCP security personnel to keep SCP-201 incentivized to remain contained and is not recommended for long-term stalling. Failures of Containment site 73 to maintain a ready supply of taffy has led to numerous escape of 201.</p>
